#  DSA-from-scratch: Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

Welcome to **DSA-from-scratch**, a comprehensive and evolving repository dedicated to mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** from the ground up using **C++** — without relying on STL shortcuts. This project is not just about code, it's about truly **understanding the mechanics** behind every structure and algorithm.

##  About This Project

This repository is a practical learning lab built with the mindset of a **problem solver** and **system builder**. Each data structure is implemented manually to deeply explore:

-  **How data is stored and accessed**
-  **Memory layout and dynamic allocation**
-  **Performance (Time & Space Complexity)**
-  **Real-world usage and applications**

Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, aiming to build your own libraries, or seeking a deeper grasp of how things work "under the hood", this repository is for you.

##  What’s Inside?

The repo is organized into standalone modules, each focusing on a specific DSA topic:

-  `Custom Vector` – Complete implementation with dynamic resizing, access methods, and memory safety. *(Used in real-world CLI project like QuickVocab)*  
-  `Linked List` – (Coming Soon) Singly, Doubly, and Circular forms  
-  `Stack & Queue` – Classic implementations with array and pointer-based logic  
-  `Trees` – Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL (planned)  
-  `Graphs` – Adjacency List, DFS, BFS, and more (upcoming)  
-  `Sorting & Searching Algorithms` – From basics to optimized versions  
-  `Project-based Usage` – Mini apps showing DSA in action

---

##  Real-World Projects Included

Projects are used to demonstrate real applications of DSA in C++. For example:

###  `QuickVocab` – Vocabulary Manager CLI Tool
Built using a custom `vector<string>` class, this tool:
- Imports text and extracts words
- Searches interactively for full or partial matches
- Supports add/remove operations
- Tests prefix-based lookups (e.g., `find all words starting with "pre"`)

It’s a clear example of how **manual data structures** can power useful applications.

## 🛠️ Tools & Language

-  Language: **C++**
-  No STL (Standard Template Library)
-  Manual memory management (via `new`, `delete`, constructors/destructors)
-  Focused on **readability**, **clarity**, and **educational comments**

---

##  Why Build From Scratch?

> Understanding how data structures work internally is essential for:
-  Cracking technical interviews
-  Becoming a better problem solver
-  Writing performance-critical code
-  Mastering C++ as a systems-level language

---

##  Future Plans

✅ Expand each topic with:
- More features
- Performance testing
- Comparison with STL equivalents  
✅ Add leetcode-style problem solvers using custom-built structures  
✅ Refactor into CMake and unit testing with GoogleTest (optional)

##  Contributions

This repository is built for **deep personal understanding**, but feel free to fork, suggest improvements, or ask questions. All constructive discussions are welcome!

##  Final Word

> *"Knowing how to use a tool is good. Knowing how it's built makes you powerful."*

This repo is my attempt to be powerful — and maybe yours too.
